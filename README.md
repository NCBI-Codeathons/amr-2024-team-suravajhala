## Project Goals
Project Goals
This project aims to integrate data/tools for the analysis of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in ESKAPEE pathogens to put them in the context of mobile genetic elements (MGEs)/plasmids and their phenotype from antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST)/clinical data. Initially, the project will focus on Acinetobacter and plasmids. More importantly, it will provide a pangenomic profile of AMR and AST in the context of MGEs/plasmids.

Keywords: Acinetobacter, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), ESKAPEE pathogens, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), pangenome, plasmids
